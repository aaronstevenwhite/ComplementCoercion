# Complement Coercion

This project contains the materials for an online replication of McElree et al. 2001. The *experiment.js* file is an Ibex data file and is generated by *create_items.py* from the *sentences* and *questions* files. To run *create_items.py*, use the following code while in the directory this project was unzipped to.

```
python create_items.py --sentences=sentences --questions=questions --output=experiment.js
```
